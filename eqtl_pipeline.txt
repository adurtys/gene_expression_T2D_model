# Description: Pipeline for eQTL Project (/project/voight_ML/adurtys/eqtl_feature/new_2019/)

# after completing gene expression lookup, the following files are obtained:
	# nearestGenes_centroidSnps_final_grouped_snps_all.txt
		# this file contains the names of the nearest three genes for each of 10,521 centroid snps

	# lookupResults_centroidSnps_final_grouped_snps_all.txt
		# this file contains the specific expression vector for each of 10,521 centroid snps across 53 genes (for nearest 3 genes, 0.05 threshold)

# other input files include:
	# /project/voight_ML/lorenzk/V2/Public/models/snplist/final_grouped_snps_all.txt
		# [0]: Chr#_Group_#
		# [1]: chr#:snp#
		# wc -l: 17,797 snps
		# cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l: 10,521 snp groups (for which we found centroid snps in the gene expression lookup pipeline)

		# [0]: rsID
		# [1]: chr#:snp#
		# wc -l: 17,797 snps

			# wc -l: 17,797 GWAS rsIDs

QUESTION 1: Out of the cis-eQTLs in GTEx, which of these meet our significance threshold (FDR < 0.05) for each tissue?
# Execution: python signif_qtl.py /project/voight_datasets/GTEx_V6p/egenes/ 0.05
	# Output: creates a directory that contains files with the matrix of qtls that are significant (q-value less than threshold) for each of the 44 tissues that have eQTL data in GTEx
		# 45 files created in the directory - 1 file for each tissue separately, and one file that contains all the eQTLs present across all tissues
		# outputs/all_eQTL_tissue_counts.txt
			# this file contains the number of eQTLs found in each of these 44 tissues individually
		# signif_QTL_snps_directory/signif_QTL_snps_allTisuses.txt
			# [0]: Tissue
			# [1]: gene_id (ENSG#)
			# [2]: gene_chr #
			# [3]: tss_distance (UNITS?? same as egenes --> postiive when variant is downstream of tss)
			# [4]: chr (of eQTL) #
			# [5]: snp pos
			# [6]: dbSNP142 rsID
			# [7]: qval
			# wc -l: 194,312 eQTLs total (not including header line, but includes duplicates ie. eQTLs that are significant in more than one tissue are listed for each tissue)

# Excution: cut -f7 signif_QTL_snps_directory/signif_QTL_snps_allTisuses.txt > all_eQTL_snp_rsIDs.txt
	# wc -l: 194,312 rsIDs

# Execution: sort all_eQTL_snp_rsIDs.txt | uniq > uniq_eQTL_snp_rsIDs.txt
	# after removing "." which was the first line, wc -l: 131,154 eQTL rsIDs

# Execution: cat uniq_GWAS_snp_rsIDs.txt uniq_eQTL_snp_rsIDs.txt > gwas_eqtl_snplist.txt
	# wc -l: 148,951 rsIDs --> this will be an input file for the plink commands
		# NOTE: 148,951 rsIDs = 131,154 eQTL rsIDs + 17,797 GWAS rsIDs

# Execution: bsub -q voight_normal -o LD_chr22.out "plink --allow-no-sex --bfile /project/voight_datasets/1kg/phaseIII_2013/plink_files/chr22 --keep /project/voight_ML/lorenzk/all_EUR_1kg.txt --exclude /project/voight_ML/lorenzk/1kg_duplicated_rsIDs.txt --extract gwas_eqtl_snplist.txt --r2 --ld-snp-list gwas_eqtl_snplist.txt --ld-window-r2 0.7 --ld-window 99999 --ld-window-kb 250000 --out LD_chr22"
	# for chromosomes 8, 12, 17: use chr#_filtered

# Execution: awk '{print $1"_"$2"_\t"$3"\t"$4"_"$5"_\t"$6}' ./*.ld > gwas_eQTL_LD
	# this gets you all the linked SNPs into one file

# Execution: python isLD.py ./plink/gwas_eQTL_LD ./uniq_eQTL_snp_rsIDs.txt ./uniq_GWAS_snp_rsIDs.txt
	# OUTPUT: creates a new version of gwas_eQTL_LD that includes only eQTL snps as snpA and only GWAS snps as snpB
	# Description: determines which eQTL snps are in LD with GWAS snps of interest

COMMNADS FROM CHRIS (TEST):
